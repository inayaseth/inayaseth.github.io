<h2>ABOUT ME!</h2>
<p>Hi! Welcome to my webiste! My name is Inaya and I am a freshman. I love to run, and at school, I am on the cross country team and I do track and field as well. Another sport I enjoy is tennis which  I normally play during the summer. In my free time, I enjoy spending time my friends and watching shows and movies. I love a lot of shows but if I had to choose a favorite, I'd probably say Gilmore Girls. I also LOVE to ski and I also love the beach and the ocean. I have a younger sister and she is in 7th grade. Now you know me a little better and thank you for visiting my website, I hope you enjoy! </p>
