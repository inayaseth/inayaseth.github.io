<h1> Journal Entry 1: 9/19/23 </h1>
<p> Hi journal, This is my very first entry. I am writing this at the end of class today. Today I learned how to use Terminal and I also made my first token on github. I can now see my website online which is cool. I am excited to continue working on my website and watch it come together over time. </p>

<h1> Journal Entry 2: 9/21/23 </h1>
<p> Hi Journal, Last class I learned a lot. Firstly, we all made repositories on Github to activate our websites so now, I am able to see my website online. All I have to do is put the name of my site in my browser and I can see my website. This is because the local version of my site is now connect to the remote version using terminal code. When I put something into terminal it connects and get published on the internet. How I put my updated code online: 1. Go to Terminal 2. cd ./desktop 3. cd ./inayaseth.github.io 4. git add . 5. git commit -m "newchanges"6. git push </p>

<h1> Journal Entry 3: 9/29/23 </h1>
<p> Hi Journal. I've made a lot of progress on my website this week which is I am excited about. I made a lot of progress on the project I am working on for my mom's birthday. I also now know that if I have any questions or if I want to learn how to do something, I can google it and search for "W3 Schools" which is a great site to use.</p>
