<h1> Journal Entry 1: 9/19/23 </h1>
<p> Hi journal, This is my very first entry. I am writing this at the end of class today. Today I learned how to use Terminal and I also made my first token on github. I can now see my website online which is cool. I am excited to continue working on my website and watch it come together over time. -Inaya </p>

<h1> Journal Entry 2: 9/21/23 </h1>
<p> Hi Journal, Last class I learned a lot. Firstly, we all made repositories on Github to activate our websites so now, I am able to see my website online. All I have to do is put the name of my site in my browser and I can see my website. This is because the local version of my site is now connect to the remote version using terminal code. When I put something into terminal it connects and get published on the internet. </p>
