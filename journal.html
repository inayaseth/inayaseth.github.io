<h2>JOURNAL ENTRIES!</h2>
<h1> Journal Entry 1: 9/19/23 </h1>
<p> Hi journal, This is my very first entry. I am writing this at the end of class today. Today I learned how to use Terminal and I also made my first token on github. I can now see my website online which is cool. I am excited to continue working on my website and watch it come together over time. </p>

<h1> Journal Entry 2: 9/21/23 </h1>
<p> Last class I learned a lot. Firstly, we all made repositories on Github to activate our websites so now, I am able to see my website online. All I have to do is put the name of my site in my browser and I can see my website. This is because the local version of my site is now connect to the remote version using terminal code. When I put something into terminal it connects and get published on the internet. How I put my updated code online: </p>

 
<ol>
<p>
<li>Go to Terminal 
<li>cd ./desktop 
<li>cd ./inayaseth.github.io
<li>git add . 
<li>git commit -m "newchanges"
<li>git push
</p>
</ol>


<h1> Journal Entry 3: 9/29/23 </h1>
<p> Hi. I've made a lot of progress on my website this week which is I am excited about. I made a lot of progress on the project I am working on for my mom's birthday. I also now know that if I have any questions or if I want to learn how to do something, I can google it and search for "W3 Schools" which is a great site to use.</p>

<h1> Journal Entry 4: 10/2/23 </h1>
<p> Today, I had a lab with Molly and I finished my first real project for my website. It's a birthday card for my mom. I had to google a lot  and ask questions in class and in labs since there was a lot of stuff that I had no idea how to do at first but in the end I figuired everything out and I am happy with how the project turned out. I learned how to add music by downloading a video from youtube and converting it to an mp3 file and then I added it into a audio tag. I also have a function that makes the song play automatically when you click on the screen. One thing that was especially challenging was getting all of the puzzle pieces to fit togehter properly on screen but in the end, I got it to work. I also didn't know how to move my "Happy Birthday" text to the side of the screen but I learned and now I know how to do that in the future by using "text-align: right;" in the style section which is where I also adjust the font, font size, color and other stuff.</p>


<h1> Journal Entry 5: 10/3/23 </h1>
<p> Today in class I made a project called 1,000 boxes. It's basically what it sounds like, 1,000 boxes on the screen but when you hover over them they change colors. It was pretty straightforward to make since a lot of the code was on the class slides/sketchbook. </p>

<h1> Journal Entry 6: 10/5/23 </h1>
<p> Hi. Today in class I made my person card on codepen.io. It was fun and I love the image and gif I added to my person card.</p>

<h1> Journal Entry 7: 10/12/23 </h1>
<p> Today I had class and we learned about javascript. I learend how to add an event listener: document.addEventListener("click", function(){console.log("hello")}) 
When I inspect it online and go to the console log, I can see the "hello" and every time I click on the screen, it counts the number of clicks! Now I am going to push on terminal so that this journal entry is added to my remote gihub website.</p>

<h1> Journal Entry 8: 10/17/23 </h1>
<p> Hi. Today in  class I made an animation. It is 2 shapes that move for 5 seconds on screen and there's also a picture of a cute animal in the middle.</p>

<h1> Journal Entry 9: 10/19/23 </h1>
<p> Today in  class I changed some of the images on my home page on my website. I have also started a new jumpscare project since Halloween is coming up. Right now all I have is a black square but I'm going to add a gif and music</p>

<h1> Journal Entry 10: 10/24/23 </h1>
<p> During comp sci today, I made a lot of progress on my jumpscare. I  now have 2 images of clowns and I added an event listener so that on click, the clown rotates 70 degrees and transforms into a different clwown and a scary sound plays. I did all of this by using javascript and adding an event listener and function insdie of it. This is what I think a funciton is: A set of code that performs somen kind of task that you can call back to later when you need it, like an input and output. This is what an event listener is: An event listener listens for an interaction, for example a click, and when you interact, it does something, this is where I added the function in my jumpscare to tell the evenntn listener what to do on click. Javascript is differnt from HTML because in java you use "="" and camel case which is different than in HTML where you use colons and semicolons. </p>
